ident Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has split with the legal team that has shepherded him through a criminal investigation that included a high-profile FBI raid, a source familiar with the change said Wednesday.
The split could signal a shift in legal strategy and comes amid mounting pressure on Cohen as criminal charges could become likely. Sources familiar with Cohen's plans tell CNN that his main goal right now is to have a legal team with experience in the Southern District of New York, which is handing the probe.
The first source familiar said Cohen had not yet met with prosecutors to speak about a potential deal, and it's unclear whether either side is seeking one .
