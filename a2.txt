The President's allies are trying to parse Cohen's move to switch up his legal team, which has sparked a fresh round of concern that Trump's longtime attorney could flip at any moment.


Judge denies President's request to confidentially contest seized Cohen documents
Trump's allies said they're unsure of Cohen's motivation for the change. But they worry that the pressure he's facing -- and the prospect of criminal charges -- could inspire him to turn on Trump. 
"He is facing the end of a barrel," one Trump ally said of Cohen.
"This is very disturbing," another Trump ally said of Cohen's legal reshuffling, noting that the President has "got to be extremely worried," about the potential Cohen may cooperate with prosecutors, particularly given Cohen's deep ties to the Trump family business.
"Who the f--- knows what Michael Cohen did all those years?" the second source said.
Few people were familiar with exactly what kind of work Cohen was doing on behalf of Trump or his family, according to people close to the President and former Trump campaign staffers, so it is difficult for them to gauge what kind of information Cohen may have to offer if he were to strike a deal with prosecutors.
